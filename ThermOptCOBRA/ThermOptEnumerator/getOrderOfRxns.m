function [order,bins,binsizes] = getOrderOfRxns(model)
% To get the order of reactions based on the connected components obtained
%
% USAGE: 
%   [order,bins,binsizes] = getOrderOfRxns(model)
%
% INPUTS:
%     model:     COBRA model structure for which the order of reaction has to be obtained
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     order:      Reaction IDs
%     bins:       Bins defining the IDs of connected components in which the reactions belong
%     binsizes:   Size of the connected components obtained
